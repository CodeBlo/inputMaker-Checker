# inputMaker-Checker
Makes random inputs and gives the output if it is not an infinite loop. This is my code final code for assignment 3.
It could be wrong. By using this program you take the full responsibility.

Put the input files to inputs directory. Output files to outputs directory.
File name's should include .txt.
Only works for mac now. I'm trying to add a version for windows too.

The random code could make an infinite loop. If it creates an infinite loop, just stop the program and try with new random input.

Have a nice day you all :)
